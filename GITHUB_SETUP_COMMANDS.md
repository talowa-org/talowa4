# GitHub Repository Setup Commands

After creating the new GitHub repository, run these commands:

## 1. Add the new remote origin
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/talowa.git
```

## 2. Push all commits to the new repository
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify the push was successful
```bash
git remote -v
```

## 4. Check the repository status
```bash
git status
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username and `talowa` with your chosen repository name.

## Expected Output:
- All files should be pushed to the new repository
- GitHub should show the complete project with README
- Repository should display the live demo links
- All commits and history should be preserved
