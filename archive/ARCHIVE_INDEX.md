### **2. Alternative Implementations** (`alternative_implementations/`)
Different approaches and implementations that were tried:
- `lib/main_fixed.dart` - Fixed main entry point

- `native_voice_service.dart` - Native voice implementation
- `reliable_voice_service.dart` - Reliable voice service
- `scalable_auth_service.dart` - Scalable auth service
- `simple_voice_service.dart` - Simple voice service
- `working_voice_service.dart` - Working voice service

### **5. Deprecated Screens** (`deprecated_screens/`)
Screen implementations that were replaced or consolidated:
- `simple_feed_screen.dart` - Simple feed implementation
- `working_feed_screen.dart` - Working feed version
- `network_screen.dart` - Old network screen
- `post_widget_test_screen.dart` - Post widget tests
- `services_test_screen.dart` - Services test screen
- `simple_post_test_screen.dart` - Simple post tests

### **6. Deprecated Widgets** (`deprecated_widgets/`)
Widget implementations that were replaced or are no longer used:
- `error_boundary.dart` - Error boundary widget implementation
- `voice_assistant_widget.dart` - Voice assistant widget (speech-to-text disabled)

### **7. Deprecated Scripts** (`deprecated_scripts/`)
Utility scripts that are no longer needed:
- `fix_all_stats.dart` - Stats fixing utility script

## 🔄 **Why These Files Are Preserved**

### **Learning Value** 📚
- Shows the evolution of the codebase
- Documents different approaches tried
- Provides examples of problem-solving methods

### **Future Reference** 🔍
- Can be referenced when implementing similar features
- Useful for understanding why certain approaches were chosen
- Helps avoid repeating past mistakes

### **Code Reuse** ♻️
- Components can be extracted and reused
- Alternative implementations might be useful in different contexts
- Test files can be adapted for new features

### **Debugging** 🐛
- Historical implementations can help debug issues
- Shows what was tried before current solutions
- Provides context for current implementation decisions

## 📋 **Usage Guidelines**

### **When to Reference Archive**
- ✅ When implementing similar features
- ✅ When debugging complex issues
- ✅ When exploring alternative approaches
- ✅ When learning about the codebase evolution

### **When NOT to Use Archive**
- ❌ Don't copy archived code directly without review
- ❌ Don't use deprecated services in production
- ❌ Don't rely on experimental implementations
- ❌ Don't use test files as production code

## 🔧 **Archive Maintenance**

### **Adding New Files**
When archiving new files:
1. Place in appropriate category folder
2. Update this index
3. Add brief description of why it was archived
4. Note the date of archiving

### **Cleaning Archive**
Periodically review and:
- Remove truly obsolete files
- Consolidate similar implementations
- Update documentation
- Ensure files are still accessible
